        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
        <p>Hello! As you might have seen on the <a href="index.html">Main Page</a>, my name is Robert Chavana! I am a 23 year old software developer out of San Antonio, Texas, home of the Alamo!</p>
        <p>I've always been interested in programming, ever since I was rather young, and I'm glad to finally be making my dreams a reality! However, when I'm not sitting in my chair staring at lines of code, there are some other things I enjoy doing!</p>
        <p>I love a good book, and have a small library of my own, although I've unfortunately lost quite a few to time and life. Some of my favorite authors are David Weber, Harry Turtledove, and Eric Flint (I bet you can't guess what genres I prefer)</p>
        <p>WI have undertaken a few personal projects, and have recently graduated from <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>!</p>

        <p>If you have any questions, or perhaps want to collaborate, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>!</p> I'm open to all sorts of things, and willing to learn!
        <p>If you want to see some of my projects, you can check the <a href="projects.html">Projects page</a>.
