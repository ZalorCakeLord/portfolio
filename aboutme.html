        <p>Hello! As you might have seen on the <a href="index.html">Main Page</a>, my name is Robert Chavana! I am a 23 year old software developer out of San Antonio, Texas, home of the Alamo!</p>
        <p>I've always been interested in programming, ever since I was rather young, and I'm glad to finally be making my dreams a reality! However, when I'm not sitting in my chair staring at lines of code, there are some other things I enjoy doing!</p>
        <p>I love a good book, and have a small library of my own, although I've unfortunately lost quite a few to time and life. Some of my favorite authors are David Weber, Harry Turtledove, and Eric Flint (I bet you can't guess what genres I prefer)</p>
        <p>While I am presently rather lacking on professional experience, I have undertaken a few personal projects, and am currently a student with <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>! Hopefully with their help I'll be able to take my skills to the next level!</p>

      <p style="font-size:21px;">A few examples of personal projects I have undertaken include:</p>
      <ol style="margin:70px;">
        <li><p>A Discord bot (who hasn't made one of these?)</p>

        <li>cross compatibility between 1 and 2</li>
        <li><p>currently working on a html/js based file explorer, because windows explorer likes to play games with me.</p>
